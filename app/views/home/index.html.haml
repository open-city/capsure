    %p 
      <strong>Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy meetings</strong>, or <a href='https://portal.chicagopolice.org/portal/page/portal/ClearPath/Get%20Involved/How%20CAPS%20works/Beat%20Meetings'>CAPS meetings</a>, are occasional sit-downs between the Chicago Police Department and Chicago residents. 
    %p 
      CAPS meetings are the place to meet the cops that work your beat, chat about local problems, and work together to fix them.
    %p
      CAPSure lets you find out <strong>when</strong> and <strong>where</strong> your next meeting is, in an effort to get more Chicagoans involved in community policing.
